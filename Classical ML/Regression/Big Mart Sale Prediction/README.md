# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction

# Overview
Sales forecasting enables businesses to allocate resources for future growth while
managing cash flow properly. Sales forecasting also assists firms in precisely estimating
their expenditures and revenue, allowing them to predict their short- and long-term
success. Retail Sales Forecasting also assists retailers in meeting customer
expectations by better understanding consumer purchasing trends. This results in more
efficient use of shelf and display space within the retail establishment and optimal use of
inventory space.

The Bigmart sales forecast project can help you comprehend project creation in a
professional atmosphere. This project entails extracting and processing data in the
Amazon Redshift database before further processing and building various
machine-learning models for sales prediction.
We will study several data processing techniques, exploratory data analysis, and
categorical correlation with Chi-squared, Cramer’s v tests, and ANOVA. In addition to
basic statistical models like Linear Regression, we will learn how to design cutting-edge
machine-learning models like Gradient Boosting and Generalized Additive Models. We
will investigate splines and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), as well as
ensemble techniques like model stacking and model blending, and evaluate these
models for the best results.

# Aim
This data science project aims to build and evaluate different predictive models and
determine the sales of each product at a particular store. This analysis will help BigMart
understand the properties of products and stores, which are crucial in increasing sales
and developing better business strategies.
Data Description

● item_visibility: visibility of the product in the outlet
● item_type: category of the product such as Dairy, Soft Drink, Household, etcs
● item_mrp: Maximum retail price of the product
● outlet_identifier: unique identification number for particular outlets
● outlet_establishment_year: the year in which the outlet was established
● outlet_size: the size of the outlet, such as small, medium, and high
● outlet_location_type: location type in which the outlet is located, such as Tier 1, 2
